::: {#hero-heading}
I am a Leader, an Innovator and Problem Solver with extensive experience in building Digital transformation, Operational Excellence and Data Science initiatives. I have been running cross-functional, diverse and distributed teams across the globe. I have lived in countries like in US, France, Norway, Oman and India. I have been fortunate to be part of building some industry leading state of art technologies in domain of reservoir simulation, production monitoring, fiber optics, digital oilfields and now predictive maintenance & data science. In my present work as Regional Data Science lead of Middle East, North Africa and Asia Pacific for Halliburton, I spend significant portion of my time mentoring organizations, coaching executives, and peers (\> 200) embarking in digital strategy, analytics and machine learning journey, in addition to looking after all the opportunity pipeline and project execution.
